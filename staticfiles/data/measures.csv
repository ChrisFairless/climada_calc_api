Mangroves,mangroves_tc_people,"Mangroves are coastal forests that protect communities from damaging waves during storms. As waves pass through the mangroves, they lose energy, making the waves smaller and less likely to cause flooding further inland. Mangroves are also a great natural solution, increasing carbon storage, biodiversity, and even tourism in the region. They won't be an appropriate solution everywhere as they can disrupt existing coastal industries such as fish farming.",tropical_cyclone,people,whole_project,20000000,0,even_coverage,100,100,1,6,0,1.05,0,"coastal_flood,carbon_storage,biodiversity",USD,m/s,km,FALSE
